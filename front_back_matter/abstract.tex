\chapter*{Abstract}
The existence of heavy partners of the top quark with charge \nicefrac{5}{3}
is a common prediction of many solution to the Standard Model hierarchy
problem. The search for the pair-production of top partners in $\mathrm{pp}$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = \unit[7]{TeV}$ with the CMS detector at the LHC is reported. The
data sample includes all of the statistics of 2011, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of
$\unit[5]{fb^{-1}}$.
New techniques and kinematical variables are developed in order to enhance
the rejection of the backgrounds.
The number of events passing these selections is consistent with the
expectations from Standard Model backgrounds and no excess is found.
Exclusion limits are set at 95\% confidence level.
