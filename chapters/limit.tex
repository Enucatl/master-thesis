\chapter{Limit}
The events passing the kinematical selection are compared with expectations
from Standard Model background sources. The number of expected events from
the signal Monte Carlo is shown in table~\ref{tab:signal_yields}. The
backgrounds are compared to the observed event yields in
table~\ref{tab:background_yields}.
\input{tables/signal_yields}
\input{tables/background_yields}
No significant excess over the SM expectations is observed, and we can set
lower bounds on the masses of the top partners.
Exclusion limits are computed at the 95\% confidence level for an event
counting experiment~\cite{2010acat.confE..57M}.

\section{Calculation of the observed limit}
A modified frequentist method is used at the LHC
experiments~\cite{ATLAS:1379837}, known as the \CLs method.
The test statistic and the treatment of nuisance parameters are described in
this section.

The expected \TP event yields are denoted by $s$, the backgrounds as
$b$. We also introduce the usual \emph{signal strength modifier} $\mu$.
The systematic uncertainties described in~\ref{chap:systematics} are
introduced as nuisance parameters (denoted together as $\theta$) for the number of expected signal and
background events. They become then functions of these parameters
$s(\theta)$ and $b(\theta)$.

The systematic error \emph{pdf}s $\rho(\theta | \tilde\theta)$ are taken as
gaussians. The mean of the gaussian $\tilde \theta$ is the default value of
the nuisance parameter.
We then re-interpret these systematic errors \emph{pdf}s as posteriors given
by imaginary measurements $\tilde \theta$, as in Bayes' theorem (with flat
$\pi_\theta(\theta)$ priors):
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(\theta|\tilde \theta) \sim p(\tilde \theta | \theta)
    \pi_\theta(\theta)
\end{equation*}
This point of view allows to represent all statistical errors in a
frequentist context: the $p(\tilde \theta|\theta)$ can be used in a sampling
fashion to construct the test statistics, and to constrain the likelihood of
the main measurement.

The procedure for the calculation of the observed limit then includes the
following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We construct the likelihood function with a Poisson
        distribution:
        \begin{equation*}
            \lhood(\text{data} | \mu, \theta) = \dfrac{(\mu s +
            b)^n}{n!}e^{-\mu s - b} p(\tilde \theta | \theta)
        \end{equation*}
        where \emph{data} represents the actual observed event yields, or
        pseudo-experiments constructed by sampling distributions as
        discussed below.
    \item In order to test the compatibility of the data with the background
        only and signal$+$background hypotheses we build a test statistic
        $\tilde{q}_\mu$  based on the profile likelihood ratio:
        \begin{equation*}
            \tilde{q}_\mu = -2 \log \dfrac{\lhood(\text{data}|\mu,
            \hat{\theta}_\mu)}{\lhood(\text{data}|\hat{\mu},
            \hat{\theta})}
        \end{equation*}
        With the constraint that $0 \leq \hat\mu \leq \mu$. The $0 \leq
        \hat\mu$ is obvious, as the signal rate must be positive, while the
        upper constraint means that fluctuations of the data such that
        $\hat\mu \geq \mu$ are not considered as evidence against the signal
        hypothesis.
        The value of $\hat{\theta}_\mu$ is the conditional maximum
        likelihood estimator of $\theta$, given $\mu$, while the values
        $\hat\mu$ and $\hat\theta$ give the global maximum of the
        likelihood.
    \item The observed value $\tilde{q}_\mu^{\text{obs}}$ for the $\mu$
        under test is calculated.
    \item The values of the nuisance parameters best describing the observed
        data, \ie maximizing the likelihood, are computed for the background
        only and signal$+$background hypotheses. We denote these values as
        $\hat{\theta}_0^{\text{obs}}$ and
        $\hat{\theta}_{\mu}^{\text{obs}}$ respectively.
    \item Monte Carlo pseudo-experiments are made to construct
        \emph{pdf}s $f(\tilde{q}_\mu|\hat{\theta}_{\mu}^{\text{obs}})$ and $f(\tilde{q}_\mu|\hat{\theta}_{0}^{\text{obs}})$ 
        Note that the buisance parameters are fixed for the purposes of
        generating these pseudo-datasets, but are allowed to float in fits
        needed to evaluate the test statistic.
        This gives good coverage properties~\cite{2006sppp.conf..112C}.
    \item We calculate two $p$-values for the $b$-only and $s+b$ hypotheses:
        \begin{align*}
            1 - p_b &= P(\tilde{q}_\mu \geq \tilde{q}_\mu^{\text{obs}} |
            b \text{-only}) &= \int_{q_{0}^{\text{obs}}}^\infty
            f(\tilde{q}_\mu|\hat{\theta}_{0}^{\text{obs}}) \mathrm{\,d}
            \tilde{q}_\mu\\
            p_\mu &= P(\tilde{q}_\mu \geq \tilde{q}_\mu^{\text{obs}} | s+b)
            &= \int_{q_{\mu}^{\text{obs}}}^\infty
            f(\tilde{q}_\mu|\hat{\theta}_{\mu}^{\text{obs}}) \mathrm{\,d}
            \tilde{q}_\mu
        \end{align*}
        and \CLs as the ratio of these two probabilities:
        \begin{equation*}
            \CLs = \dfrac{p_\mu}{1 - p_b}
        \end{equation*}
    \item If for $\mu = 1$, $\CLs \leq 5\%$, we state that the \TP is
        excluded with 95\% confidence level.
        Limits calculated with this \CLs method are known to be
        conservative, \ie the confidence level is actually higher than 95\%.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Calculation of the expected limit}
In order to calculate the expected limit and the bands corresponding to
$1$ and $2\sigma$ fluctuations, we generate many background-only
pseudo-experiments and calculate \CLs as in the observed limit procedure. 

Then, a cumulative probability distribution of results can be plotted, and
the point at which the distribution crosses the quantile of 50\% is the
median expected value, to be taken as the expected limit. The $\pm 1\sigma$
(68\%) is defined by the crossings of the 16\% and 84\% quantiles. Crossings
at the $2.5\%$ and $97.5\%$ define the $\pm 2\sigma$ band.

\section{Results}
The event yields from the three decay channels are
combined when setting the limits.
The expected and observed limits are shown in
figure~\ref{fig:limit}.
The expected limit is~\unit[658]{GeV}, the observed limit
is~\unit[633]{GeV}.
