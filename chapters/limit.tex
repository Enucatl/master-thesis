\chapter{Limit}
The events passing the kinematical selection are compared with expectations
from Standard Model background sources. The number of expected events from
the signal Monte Carlo is shown in table~\ref{tab:signal_yields}. The
backgrounds are compared to the observed event yields in
table~\ref{tab:background_yields}.

No significant excess over the SM expectations is observed, and we can set
lower bounds on the masses of the top partners.

Exclusion limits are computed at the 95\% confidence level for an event
counting experiment. The event yields from the three decay channels are
combined when setting the limits. The limit is computed using the CLs method
and an LHC-style profile likelihood. Poisson statistics are used to model
the signal and gaussian distributions are used for integrating over nuisance
parameters. The expected and observed limits are shown in
figure~\ref{fig:limit}.
The expected limit is~\unit[658]{GeV}, the observed limit
is~\unit[633]{GeV}.
