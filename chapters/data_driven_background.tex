\chapter{A data-driven background estimate}
We identified three sources of backgrounds
(page~\pageref{page:background_categories}). The backgrounds from charge
misidentification and from non-prompt leptons are analysed with data driven
techniques.
\section{Charge misidentification}
Standard Model processes with prompt leptons of opposite charge are very
common at the LHC. They can contribute to the top partners background if the
charge of one of the leptons is incorrectly measured.
For muons in the \pt range considered in this analysis, the charge misidenfication rate is extremely small ($10^{-4}-10^{-5}$) and their contribution to the background is
negligible~\cite{susy2011}. The magnitude of this contribution due to electrons can be derived from the data by using the \Z boson resonance. 
The fraction of misidentified leptons is obtained by considering events with two electrons in which the invariant mass of the leptons falls inside the 
\Z boson mass window: $\unit[76]{GeV}< M(\Lep \Lep) <\unit[106]{GeV}$. These events must pass all cleaning and trigger requirements and the electrons are likewise required to pass all 
quality cuts, but the selection based on the number of jets. As can be seen in the tables~\ref{tab:ZWindowBkgd} and~\ref{tab:ZWindowSig}, this sample is expected to be completely dominated by $\Z$+jets.

\end{table}


Applying the same method to data we obtain $858330$ events in the \Z mass
window; $1014$ events remain upon applying the same-sign requirement. The probability of misidentifying the charge of each 
lepton is computed by assuming that the entirety of the same-sign contribution is due to misidentified \Z+jets events and is found to be $5.89 \times 10^{-4}$. To confirm that this upper limit is close to the true probability, we consider the dilepton invariant mass spectrum shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ZWindowMassPeak}. Both 
the simulation and the mass spectrum suggest that the upper limit is close
to the true probability (within approximately 1\% according to the
simulation). We note that this  estimated charge misidentification
probability is consistent with the measurement in~\cite{susy2011}.

\caption{The dilepton invariant mass spectrum for electrons in data. The opposite-sign distributions are shown in blue and 
the same-sign ones are in red. Both distributions are normalized to unit area.}
\label{fig:ZWindowMassPeak}
\end{figure}

The number of expected same-sign events due to charge misidentification is estimated by considering the total number of events passing the 
full selection, but having oppositely charged leptons. These events are
multiplied by
the charge misidentification probability.

\section{Same-sign non-prompt background}
Non-prompt leptons are the result of the decays of heavy flavour quarks,
decays in flight or conversions. The description of this background in the
Monte Carlo samples is unsatisfactory, and a data-driven estimate is needed.

The so called \emph{tight-loose} method is employed. This method defines two
types of leptons: a \emph{tight} lepton, which is exactly the same as
in~\ref{sec:muon_selection} and~\ref{sec:electron_selection}, and a
\emph{loose} lepton, whose selection criteria are relaxed as follows:
\begin{description}
    \item[loose electron]\hspace*{\fill}\\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item no transverse impact parameter requirements
            \item no conversion rejection
            \item relative isolation relaxed from 0.15 to 0.60
        \end{itemize}
    \item[loose muon]\hspace*{\fill}\\ 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item transverse impact parameter relaxed from
                \unit[0.02]{cm} to \unit[2]{cm}
            \item relative isolation relaxed from 0.20 to 0.40
            \item no requirements on the number of hits in the tracker, nor
                on the number of muon chambers with matching segments
            \item normalized $\chi^2 < 50$ instead of 10
        \end{itemize}
\end{description}
These selections are studied to include \eg leptons from heavy flavour
hadrons: they are usually close to a jet, hence not isolated, and they also
have a larger impact parameter, as the hadron decays on a much larger
timescale with respect to a \TP or a top quark.
Conversion electrons also have to be taken into account, so that the
requirement against conversion rejection has to be eliminated as well.

The relevant quantity is the tight to loose ratio, representing the
probability that a non-prompt lepton is identified as tight:
\begin{equation*}
    f_\Lep = \dfrac{\text{number of tight leptons}}{\text{number of loose
    leptons}}
\end{equation*}

However, this ratio is close to the probability for a non-prompt lepton to
pass the tight selection only if it is calculated on a sample where the
prompt component is negligible. Such a sample can be built from the
\texttt{SingleMu} and \texttt{DoubleElectron} primary datasets by enforcing
cuts aiming to reject leptons from \W and \Z bosons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item exactly one loose lepton in each event
    \item at least one jet with $\pt > \unit[40]{GeV}$ and $\Delta R > 1$
        relative to the lepton
    \item $\met < \unit[25]{GeV}$
    \item $\mt < \unit[25]{GeV}$
    \item extended \Z veto: reject the event if the invariant mass of the
        lepton and any jet is in the \unit[76-106]{GeV} window
\end{itemize}
The \met and \mt selections are meant to exclude the presence of \W bosons,
and the \Z veto now includes all the jets, as a second lepton can be incorrectly
identified as a jet.

Even with this selection, the contamination from prompt leptons is still
fairly large. This can be estimated from the Monte Carlo $\Wjets$ and
$\Zjets$ samples. The results are shown in
tables~\ref{tab:FRwMCEl} and~\ref{tab:FRwMCMu}.

In order to avoid being directly dependent on the MC, we note that the
contamination from prompt leptons is negligible if we restrict the \pt range
of the leptons to $\unit[25]{GeV} < \pt < \unit[35]{GeV}$. The overlap of
this \pt range with that of the signal selection in the analysis ($\pt >
\unit[30]{GeV}$) is small, but when the tight to loose ratio is corrected
for the contribution of prompt leptons, it becomes nearly independent from
the \pt (see figure~\ref{fig:CorFRvsLepPt}).

\end{table}

With this \pt restriction, the contributions from prompt leptons in the MC
becomes negligible (tables~\ref{tab:FRwMCEl_Pt2535}
and~\ref{tab:FRwMCMu_Pt2535}), and in the following analysis we use only the values
from the data:
\begin{align*}
    f_\E &= 0.112 \pm 0.009 \text{ stat.}\\
    f_\M &= 0.285 \pm 0.003 \text{ stat.}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Heavy flavour content of the samples}
The samples in which these ratios are measured are selected without any
requirements on the heavy flavour content. However, a large part of the
non-prompt background is expected to arise from semileptonic \ttbar. We
therefore have to check that our prediction is stable with respect to
variations in the flavour content.

The b-tagging algorithm described in~\ref{sec:btagging} is used to enrich
our samples of leptons coming from b quarks. This doesn't change the values
calculated in the previous section, within the statistical uncertainties:
\begin{align*}
    f_\E^{\text{btag}} &= 0.120 \pm 0.009 \text{ (stat.)}\\
    f_\M^{\text{btag}} &= 0.280 \pm 0.003 \text{ (stat.)}
\end{align*}
